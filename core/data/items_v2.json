Utilizing both K-means and K-medoids clustering, the research categorizes drivers into aggressive and non-aggressive groups based on their driving behavior. A two-level mixed-effects linear regression model reveals that lane-changing duration decreases with higher speed limits during heavy rain for aggressive drivers, while non-aggressive drivers take longer to change lanes under congested traffic conditions. The study's methodology provides valuable insights for designing lane-changing models for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and offers practical implications for traffic management and safety interventions under adverse weather conditions.",

    "description": "This study explores the driver-related risk factors in fatal road traffic crashes linked to alcohol or drug impairment in Norway between 2005 and 2015. Leveraging data from forensic toxicology databases and crash registries, the research investigates the prevalence and impact of substance use on unsafe driving behaviors, such as speeding, non-use of seatbelts, and driving without a valid license. The analysis reveals that impaired drivers are significantly more likely to engage in these risky behaviors compared to their sober counterparts. The study also highlights variations in risk based on the type of substance, with alcohol and stimulants showing strong associations with all three behaviors. Cannabis use was notably linked to unlicensed driving, while medicinal drugs were associated with seatbelt non-use but not speeding. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including stricter enforcement of traffic laws, enhanced public awareness campaigns, and tailored driver education programs. The research contributes valuable insights for policymakers and road safety authorities aiming to reduce fatalities and improve traffic safety.

Employing a mixed logit model, the analysis explores the heterogeneous effects of driver, vehicle, roadway, and environmental factors on crash outcomes. Key findings reveal that rural roadways, high-speed limits, and curve roads significantly increase crash severity, particularly in DUI-related cases. Non-DUI crashes show distinct influences, with older drivers, motorcycles, and poor lighting conditions playing crucial roles.

Logistic regression models reveal significant links between these behaviors and both DWI and RWI, highlighting the complex interplay of risk factors. The findings suggest that binge drinking, misuse of prescription pain medications, and sexual risk behaviors are among the strongest predictors. Additionally, adolescents involved in physical altercations, particularly on school property, are more likely to engage in DWI and RWI.

    "description": "This study explores the influence of neighborhood-level sociodemographic factors on seat belt use across Tennessee, using police crash report data geocoded to census tracts. By employing Tobit regression models, it evaluates the relationship between seat belt use rates and variables like race, household income, education, and vehicle ownership. Results indicate significant disparities in seat belt use based on neighborhood characteristics, with lower rates in areas with higher percentages of minority populations and lower educational attainment. The study also finds that metropolitan areas exhibit higher compliance compared to rural regions. It highlights the effectiveness of targeted safety campaigns and enforcement strategies, emphasizing the need for geographically and demographically tailored interventions.

Using data from the Critical Analysis Reporting Environment (CARE) system, the research employs a random parameters logit model with heterogeneity in means and variances to examine 8,681 crash cases, categorized into single and multivehicle crashes. Key findings reveal that single-vehicle crashes on rural roads, under dark conditions or rainy weather, significantly increase the likelihood of severe injuries. In multivehicle crashes, factors such as airbag deployment and angled collisions notably influence fatal injury risks. The study underscores the importance of targeted interventions, including roadway design enhancements, advanced driver-assistance systems, and tailored public awareness campaigns.

By assessing the effectiveness of converting stop-controlled intersections to signalized ones, the research seeks to determine whether these changes can reduce crash frequencies and improve safety outcomes for older drivers. The study also explores the broader impact of signalization across various demographic groups and intersection types, aiming to provide evidence-based recommendations for infrastructure improvements.",
    "method": "The research utilizes four years of crash data from Florida, encompassing 30 rural intersections. The methodology integrates Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to estimate Crash Modification Factors (CMFs). Additionally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-means clustering algorithms are used to identify similar control sites for comparison. The quasi-induced exposure method is applied to evaluate the relative risk of crashes for elderly versus non-elderly drivers, ensuring a robust analysis of signalization impacts on different age groups and intersection configurations.",

    "description": "This research investigates the severity of bicycle-vehicle crashes in Tamil Nadu, India, focusing on data from 2009 to 2017. By employing Latent Class Clustering (LCC), the study categorizes crashes into five distinct clusters, each characterized by unique factors such as road type, lighting conditions, and cyclist behavior. The analysis reveals critical insights, such as the heightened risk of severe injuries on highways with median separators and during overtaking maneuvers. Using binary logistic regression within each cluster, the study identifies significant contributors to injury severity, including road separation, cyclist demographics, and environmental conditions. The findings emphasize the importance of targeted interventions, such as dedicated cycling infrastructure and public awareness campaigns, to reduce crash severity and enhance cyclist safety.",

The research categorizes lighting into daylight, dark-with-streetlight, and dark-no-streetlight conditions, identifying critical risk factors associated with each. Key findings reveal that fatal crashes at night are particularly influenced by factors such as alcohol involvement, high-speed limits, and pedestrians wearing dark clothing. During daylight, young and elderly pedestrians are disproportionately involved in crashes, often due to midblock crossings. The study emphasizes targeted countermeasures such as improved lighting, awareness campaigns, and stricter speed enforcement to address these lighting-specific crash patterns. By tailoring safety measures to lighting conditions, the study offers actionable insights for enhancing pedestrian safety in high-risk scenarios.",

    "description": "This research develops a Multivariate Zero-Inflated Poisson (MZIP) regression model to analyze crash frequencies at signalized intersections in Tennessee. By addressing the correlation among crash severities and accounting for excess zero counts, the study improves the accuracy of crash frequency predictions. Utilizing data from 1,000 intersections over five years, the model identifies key contributors to crashes, including traffic volume, intersection angle, and the proportion of trucks. The results suggest that traffic volume positively correlates with crash frequencies across all severities, while skewed intersection angles decrease crash rates. The study also highlights the role of geometric features, such as the number of left-turn lanes, in influencing crash outcomes. Recommendations include optimizing intersection designs to enhance safety and reduce crash severity.",

Elderly drivers, due to age-related cognitive and physical declines, face heightened risks at complex intersections. By assessing the effectiveness of converting stop-controlled intersections to signalized ones, the research seeks to determine whether these changes can reduce crash frequencies and improve safety outcomes for older drivers. The study also explores the broader impact of signalization across various demographic groups and intersection types, aiming to provide evidence-based recommendations for infrastructure improvements.",
    "method": "The research utilizes four years of crash data from Florida, encompassing 30 rural intersections. The methodology integrates Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to estimate Crash Modification Factors (CMFs). Additionally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-means clustering algorithms are used to identify similar control sites for comparison. The quasi-induced exposure method is applied to evaluate the relative risk of crashes for elderly versus non-elderly drivers, ensuring a robust analysis of signalization impacts on different age groups and intersection configurations.",

It highlights that traffic mix and directional volume significantly influence crash frequency. A higher percentage of motorcycles in the traffic mix tends to decrease crash risk, while directional traffic volume imbalances, particularly when the near-to-far side volume ratio is greater than one, increase crash and conflict probabilities. The study employs conditional probability models and disaggregate data analysis, focusing on crash and conflict scenarios to better understand the relationship between traffic dynamics and intersection safety.

Transition zones are defined as areas where the posted speed limit changes from high to low as drivers approach built-up areas. Using panel and multilevel modeling approaches, the study analyzes speed data collected from 20 sites in Pennsylvania. The results reveal that horizontal curves, the presence of curbs, and increased access density significantly reduce operating speeds. Conversely, wider lanes, greater lateral clearance, and certain warning signs are associated with higher speeds. The research emphasizes the need for context-sensitive designs to ensure speed reductions align with safety objectives.
