        "Key Stakeholder": "Law enforcement agencies,, judicial system, transportation agencies (DOTs), public health and behavioral health agencies, state legislatures",
        "How and where to apply": "1. Stronger penalties for BAC test refusal should be applied in states with high rates of impaired driving or test refusals, particularly where refusal undermines DUI enforcement.\n2. These penalties such as administrative license suspension, enhanced fines, or mandatory ignition interlock, are most effective when integrated with existing DUI laws and enforced consistently.\n3. NHTSA emphasizes that ?reducing BAC test refusals is an important step toward ensuring the effectiveness of impaired driving laws?. ",
        "Use in a Safe System Approach": "Supports the SSA by targeting safer users and closing enforcement gaps. Stronger refusal penalties reduce the likelihood of impaired driving by increasing the perceived consequences of illegal behavior.",
        "Proactive Implementation": "Proactive implementation includes automatic license suspension for BAC test refusal, integration with ignition interlock and substance abuse programs, and data-driven identification of repeat offenders. Supported by officer training and public awareness campaigns, these measures align with national efforts like NHTSA?s Impaired Driving Program to strengthen DUI enforcement and deterrence.",
